DONE:
-----------------------------------------
generate 1st layer
train 1st layer
test 1st layer 
train 2nd layer k-means
[all done on CIFAR]



TO DO:
-----------------------------------------
k-means in unsup generates some nan filters: due to divide by 0 when templates are not used
FIX!!!!

normalize and zero mean data after each layer!

test on a dataset 2 layer net

SpatialSAD: how to deal with input kernels, input have 3 color spaces: 3 x 2-dimensions
but then in 2nd layer we have input with many dimensions and filters are 1 x 2 dimensions:
meaning that at least now filters are shared for all input dimensions
how to connect 1st and second layer? conned table: pick M subset of inputs and compute SpatialSAD on that
or just use all of them if you have time for computation
What I would like is to learn filter, kernels that are independent of color planes
so filters in each layer are always N x 2-dimensions


CIFAR too small for 2 or more layers: switch to other dataset
switch to: SVHN dataset:
http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/
or spanish dataset on our server (even better for final use)


STUDENT TASK:
“Filter” k-means filters so that they are different: group them together and remove copies!!!
